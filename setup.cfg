# Ignore common stylistic issues that aren't critical
ignore = W293, W292, C901, W291, E226
# This config focuses on important issues while ignoring code style noise:
# - W293: blank line contains whitespace
# - W292: no newline at end of file
# - C901: function is too complex
# - W291: trailing whitespace
# - E226: missing whitespace around arithmetic operator
# Still enforces critical issues:
# - F401: unused imports
# - E501: line too long
# - F541: f-string missing placeholders
# - E128: indentation issues
